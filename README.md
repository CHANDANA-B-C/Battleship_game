# Battleship_game
Objective: The objective of Battleship is to try n sink all of the other player's ships. Player tries to hit the ships by calling out coordinates by guessing.
Board n ships: Each player places the 5 (in the code I have taken 2 ships) ships somewhere on their board.  The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. Ships may not overlap each other.  No ships may be placed on another ship. 
Playing: Player guesses the coordinates of the ships placed on board. If the guess is correct the ships got sank and for all ships sank the player wons the game.
For each wrong guess, the position guesses is marked as 'X'.
For each ship sank, the position is marked as '#'.
Total turns given in the code is 10.
